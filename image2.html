  <h1>Image 2 (5 x 7)</h1>

  <img src="image/image2.jpeg" alt="Homework 2 Image 2" width="500">

  <p>
    I chose this image because the subject felt simple but the lighting and framing made it more interesting.
    I tried to pay attention to where things sit in the frame so it doesn’t feel awkward or off-center.
    The 5 x 7 crop was harder because it forced me to tighten the composition and be more careful about what I left in and what I cut out.
