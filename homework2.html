  <h1>Homework 2: Photography & Photoshop</h1>

  <p>
    For this assignment, I ended up using my own iPhone instead of the DSLR camera. At first I thought it would be easier since I use my phone all the time, but it was actually harder than I expected. I took several photos of objects in my kitchen, like light coming through the window and everyday items on the counter. I was trying to focus on composition ideas we talked about in class, like balance and where the subject sits in the frame. I tried to use natural light to create some depth and contrast instead of using flash.

    When I brought the photos into Photoshop and started cropping them, I realized how much cropping changes the image. Once I set the crop to 1920 x 1080 pixels, the image became much smaller and tighter than I thought it would. It forced me to really think about what I wanted the viewer to focus on. For the 5 x 7 crop, I had to reposition the frame carefully so it still felt balanced and not awkward. I also adjusted the tonal range using Levels to make the shadows deeper and the highlights slightly brighter. At first I pushed it too much, but then I adjusted it to look more natural.

    Overall, this assignment made me realize that even simple photos can become more intentional through cropping and tonal adjustments. It made me think more carefully about framing and how much control editing gives you over the final image.
