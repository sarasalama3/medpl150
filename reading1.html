  <h1>Response #1: In Plato’s Cave</h1>

  <p>
    Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave” made me think differently about something I do all the time without even realizing it, which is taking pictures.
    Even though this was written before phones and social media, a lot of it feels like it was written for right now.
    Sontag says that photos aren’t just “proof” of reality. Taking a photo changes how we see things and how we experience them.

    I take pictures for a lot of reasons. Sometimes it’s to remember something, like a birthday, a trip, or just a good day with friends.
    Other times it’s because I want to post it or save it for later. But reading this made me realize that sometimes I’m taking photos
    just to feel like the moment becomes real. Sontag talks about how photos can be a way to prove you were there and that something happened.
    That feels very true today. If you go somewhere and don’t get a picture, it almost feels like you didn’t really do it, or you don’t have
    anything to show for it.

    One part that stood out to me was the idea that taking photos can make you feel less present. This happens to me a lot.
    If I’m at an event or somewhere cool, I might spend a lot of time trying to get the right picture instead of just enjoying what’s
    happening at the moment. I’ll take many photos, check them, retake them, and then I’m not fully in the moment anymore.
    It’s like I’m experiencing it through my phone.

    Sontag also explains that photography can feel like a type of control, like you’re grabbing the moment and owning it.
    I never thought about it like that, but it makes sense. She also talks about how photos can be powerful, especially when they show
    something serious like suffering or injustice. A photo can make people believe something is real and make them care more.
    But she also warns that seeing too many images like that can make people numb.

    I thought this was really important because we scroll past so many intense images online now. Even when something is actually sad
    or shocking, sometimes it starts to feel like just another post. It doesn’t always feel the way it should because we’re so used
    to seeing everything.
  </p>

  <p>
    This reading also made me think about how a photo can’t tell the whole story. A photo shows one moment, but it doesn’t explain the
    full context of what’s happening. Sontag says photos can’t really help us fully understand something on their own.
    They show the surface. That’s why I think combining image and text can be really important.

    For this class, since we’re making a lot of different projects, I want to start thinking about my work as connected instead of separate.
    I don’t want my images to feel empty or just for show. After reading Sontag, I want to be more intentional.
    I could ask myself: why am I taking this photo? What am I trying to show?
    What does this image make people feel or think?
    In a world where everyone is constantly taking and posting pictures, being thoughtful about images feels important
    and also kind of challenging.
