    I chose this photo because I liked how it looked with the natural light in my kitchen, and it felt like a simple moment that still had a clear focus.
    I tried to keep the frame balanced so your eye goes to the main subject first instead of getting distracted by everything in the background.
    Cropping helped me make the composition stronger by removing extra space and making the image feel more intentional.
