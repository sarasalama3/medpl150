    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Sara Salama, and I am a junior in the Media Studies major with a strong interest in marketing and social media.
        I am interested in how digital platforms shape culture and influence behavior.
        I am also interested in how brands tell stories through media in creative and intentional ways.
